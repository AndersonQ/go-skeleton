go-skeleton
-----------
A skeleton for go microservices


## Motivation
Besides avoiding to copy from the last microservice I've writte, a friend asked how I'd do it.
That's is how I'm doing it right now

## Run

```bash
go run main.go
```

## TODO

 - Finish the readme
 - add Makefile
 - add Dockerfile
